# OOP-Project(Cafe-Management-System)

Well this is my OOP project in which I have to manage the orders of different students of the university.
In this project, the user ask either your are here as a administratior, Cafe staff or student.

My code manages all the three users according to the input.
Now, if student logged in and the users takes it order and save it in a (.txt) file .
My code also do file handling and my all data is stored in the backup for the administration if he wants to check the record of the orders we take in one day.

You will understand each thing easily with the flow of its running.

So take a feel as an adminstrator and take orders for your cafe.
:)
